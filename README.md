# Child-Language-Analyser
Code to develop a preliminary Child Language Analyser

In this Analyser, a basic language analyser is implemented to investigate the linguistic
characteristics of children with some form of language disorders. The analyser is able to
perform basic statistical analysis on a number of linguistic features and also to present the
analysis results using some form of visualisation.

The dataset is known as ENNI [https://childes.talkbank.org/access/Clinical-MOR/
ENNI.html] which is a collection of narrative transcripts gathered for a clinical study carried out
in Alberta, Canada, to study children with language disorders. Two sets of data were collected:
the first set is from children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) â€” one form
of language disorders; and the second set is from children with the typical development (TD).
A subset of the original corpus is used in this project with 10 selected transcripts for each
group of children.
Each of the narrative transcripts is a record of the story-telling task performed by a child for
the two groups (SLI and TD), under the supervision of an examiner (investigator). The stories
are elicited by presenting pictures with a number of different animal characters to the children
participating in the study. 

1. First task was to handle the file pre-processing
2. Second was to build a class for Data Analysis
3. Third ,to visualise the data by building a class.

Python 3.6 was used to build the analyser with three seperate scripts. Documentation for the code is given in the 'Child-Language-Analyser.doc'

In the attached version, the primary focus was on data wrangling in order to format the data for visualisation.
Comparison for SLI and TD needs to be done with better visuals.

On-going development:
Further Analysis can be done from such data.
